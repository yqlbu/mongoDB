MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB. Atlas handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS, Azure, and GCP). You may use this service totally **FOR FREE**.

You may use this repo as a tool to constantly post data (ie: sensors data) to your database hosted by MongoDB Atlas.
